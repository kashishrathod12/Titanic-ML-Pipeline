# Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification Project)

## 📌 Overview
End-to-end ML pipeline to predict passenger survival using feature engineering and ML classification algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset
- Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## ⚙️ Approach
- Data cleaning (missing values)
- Feature engineering: Age groups, Title extraction, Cabin encoding
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Cross-validation

## 🚀 Results
- Best model: Random Forest
- Accuracy: **82%**
